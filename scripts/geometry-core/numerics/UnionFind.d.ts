/**
 * Implement the classic UnionFind algorithm, viz https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure
 * * Each of the entities being merged exists as an entry in an array.
 * * The index in the array is the (only!) identification of the entity.
 * * The array entry is the index of a parent in the merge process.
 * * New entries are created as singletons pointing to themselves.
 * * Merge (i,j) merges the collections containing entries (i) and (j) into a single collection.
 * * The merge process updates the indices "above" (i) and (j)
 * * The whole process is extraordinarily efficient regardless of the order that the (i,j) merges are announced.
