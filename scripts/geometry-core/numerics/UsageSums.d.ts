/**
 * Accumulator for computing average and standard deviations.
 * * Usual usage pattern:
 *   * create with `sums = new UsageSums ()`
 *   * announce data values with any combination of
 *      * `sums.accumulate (x: number)`
 *      * `sums.accumulateArray (data: numberArray)`
 *   * query properties at any time:
 *      * `sums.mean`
 *      * `sums.count`
 *      * `sums.meanSquare`
 *      * `sums.standardDeviation`
 *      * `sums.minMax`
 * * Optional `origin`
 *   * if `origin` is nonzero:
 *      * when a value `x` is announced to the `accumulate(x)` method, the value used for sums is `(x-origin)`
 *   * All queries (mean, minMax, meanSquare, standardDeviation) return values relative to the origin.
 *   * The origin can be reset in two different ways:
 *     * `setOrigin(a)` sets the saved origin value to `a`, but leaves sums unchanged.
 *       * This affects subsequence how sums are changed by `announce(x)`
 *     * `shiftOriginAndSums` sets the origin (like `sums.setOrigin (a))` and also corrects all sums and minMax so they appear that the new origin had been in effect during all prior `accumulate(x)` calls.
