/**
 * abstract methods for callbacks during sweeps of collections of StrokeCount Structures.
 * * A set of StrokeCountMaps are to be visited multiple times.
 * * The logic that controls the sweep is as below.
 * * The callback object controls the number of sweeps and can adapt its action to the respective sweeps.
 * * Note that a "false" from cb.startPass() terminates passes for this chainIndex and primitiveIndex, but all others exit the whole sequence.
 * * This logic occurs 2 or three levels deep
 *   * outer level is "chains".   Simple swept path or loops have only one outer; parity regions have one outer per loop of the parity region
 *   * second level is primitive within chain.
 *     * If the primitives in a set are "single component", second level is lowest.
 *        * startSweep() and endSweep() calls are two parameters, with undefined componentIndex
 *     * If the primitives in a set are multi-component, there is a third level looping through corresponding components.
