/** Three angles that determine the orientation of an object in space. Sometimes referred to as [Taitâ€“Bryan angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles).
 * * The matrix construction can be replicated by this logic:
 * * xyz coordinates have
 *   * x forward
 *   * y to left
 *   * z up
 *   * Note that this is a right handed coordinate system.
 *   * yaw is a rotation of x towards y, i.e. around positive z:
 *     * `yawMatrix = Matrix3d.createRotationAroundAxisIndex(2, Angle.createDegrees(yawDegrees));`
 *   * pitch is a rotation that raises x towards z, i.e. rotation around negative y:
 *     * `pitchMatrix = Matrix3d.createRotationAroundAxisIndex(1, Angle.createDegrees(-pitchDegrees));`
 *   * roll is rotation of y towards z, i.e. rotation around positive x:
 *     * `rollMatrix = Matrix3d.createRotationAroundAxisIndex(0, Angle.createDegrees(rollDegrees));`
 *   * The YPR matrix is the product
 *     * `result = yawMatrix.multiplyMatrixMatrix(pitchMatrix.multiplyMatrixMatrix(rollMatrix));`
 *   * Note that this is for "column based" matrix, with vectors appearing to the right
 *     * Hence a vector is first rotated by roll, then the pitch, finally yaw.
