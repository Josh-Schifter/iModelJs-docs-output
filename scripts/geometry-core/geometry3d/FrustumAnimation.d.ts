/**
 * context for constructing smooth motion a startFrustum and endFrustum.
 * The externally interesting calls are
 * * Create a context to shift corner0 to corner1, with the(NPC coordinate) point(fractionU, fractionV, fractionW) moving along its connecting segment, all other points rotating smoothly from the start orientation to end orientation:
 * `const context = SmoothTransformBetweenFrusta (cornerA, cornerB)`
 *  * Get any intermediate 8 corners(at fraction) with `context.fractionToWorldCorners(fraction)`
 * * Frustum corners are ordered by "x varies fastest, then y, then z", hence (xyz) order on nondimensional space is
 *   * (left lower rear) (000)
 *   * (right lower rear) (100)
 *   * (left upper rear) (010)
 *   * (right upper rear) (100)
 *   * (left lower front) (001)
 *   * (right lower front) (101)
 *   * (left upper front) (011)
 *   * (right upper front) (101)
 * * which uses names
 *    * (left,right) for horizontal (x)
 *    * (bottom, top) for vertical (y)
 *    * (rear, front) for back and front planes (z)
