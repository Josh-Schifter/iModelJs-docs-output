/**
 * A class to manage a set of edges as both (a) an array of possible members and (b) mask bits.
 * * A half edge is "in the MarkSet" if its mask is set.
 * * The MarkSet array is a superset of the half edges in the set.
 * * Entry of a HalfEdge into the set is indicated by both
 *    * adding the HalfEdge to the array
 *    * setting the mask on the half edge, edge, face, or vertex
 * * Half edges can "go out of the MarkSet" if the mask is cleared.
 *   * This clearing can happen independently of the array management.
 *   * Hence the array can contain half edges that are no longer in the MarkSet
 *   * the "remove" methods monitor this.
 * * Derived classes expand this concept for edge, vertex, or face MarkSets.
 *   * a single representative of an edge, vertex, or face is entered to the array
 *   * all edges around the edge, vertex, or face are marked with the mask
 *   * Hence the array contains one or more representatives of the edge, face, or vertex
 * * This allows quick query for both:
 *   * Testing the mask gives constant time test of whether a HalfEdge is in the set
 *   * access through the array gives direct access to the HalfEdge pointers
